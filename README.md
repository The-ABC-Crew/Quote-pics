We found quote APIs and an API from Pexels for images.
We created an html with a header, main and footer as well as h1s, ps and buttons for the user to click to display images. 
We added classes and ids to some of the elements on the html. 
We created a CSS sheet to format the images and text as desired. 
We created a JS document, in which we created variables and a list of words to exclude. 
In the JS document, we fetched data from quotepark and pexels.
We used functions to display a random image with random text in the Quote pic area on the right of the background image.
We used functions to display a random background image when the button on the header is clicked. 
We added event listeners for both buttons. 

User clicks "CLICK ME TO CHANGE BACKGROUND IMAGE" and a random image is fetched from Pexels and becomes the background image. 
User clicks "CLICK ME TO GENERATE A QUOTE PIC" buttom and an image appears with a quote on it.
